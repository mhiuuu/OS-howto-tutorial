# Environmet setups
- I'm using Arch Linux as my daily driver. However it's not too important as long as you understand your system

**May be you will need**
1. A text editor, IDE, code editor, ... whatever usable
2. Make
3. NASM - Assembler
4. Virtualization software (I'm using qemu): VirtualBox, ...

**For windows users**
 - You should use WSL - Windows subsystem for Linux however there are 2 versions of it so choose what you need
 - If you use WSL so maybe you can use it like Linux now

**For Mac users**
 - Everything you need can be found using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

**For linux users** 
 - You have the supreme power in your hand ...
