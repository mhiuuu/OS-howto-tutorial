# What is an OS?
- Due to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) an operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs

# How to build an OS from SCRATCH!!!
- Building an OS is not an easy task. Many can't make it in this field. However, I truly believe that learning about OS is the best way to understand computer and is the easiest way to have **no life** left.
- To be even worse, OS developers are some kind of genius and you won't be able to be a part of their busy schedule in this field cuz they have tons of thing to do and you are just not that important LOL #j4f

=> That is the reason why me - a 16 years old kid with nothing to do except my homework (I don't do it) decided to learn how to create a whole operating system from scratch just for my expectations and to help you - another useless person to become better at OS programming

**SO HOW TO BUILD IT?**
1. Learn the basics (What is the basics? - You named it yourself)
 - There are 3 most important aspects: Basic of CS, programming and high & low-level programming
 - Low-level programming languages are used to communicate directly with the CPU and tell it what to do and each type of CPU has its own corresponding assembly language but we will covered the x86 in this tutorial (most commonly used)
 - What languages we will use here? **Python** + **C++** + **C** + **x86 Assembly**

 **Python**: I would recommend using [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) tutorial for this

 **C & C++**: [LearnCPP](https://www.learncpp.com) is the best, even some competitive programmers - another kind of genius are recommending this. C and C++ are kind of the same so ... maybe we will check it out later 

 **Assembly**: Since I couldn't find any good tutorial about this ... WE WILL COVER IT IN ANOTHER SECTION!!! - best way to k*ll yourself

2. Start to build
 - There many greate tutorials out there so feel free to pick one for you! But in this tutorial I will try my best to gather all the information from that tutorial to actually build the best tutorial even with the beginners (I'm a beginner)
 - Learn what is an OS, kernel, shell, bootloader, stack, memory segmentation, ...
